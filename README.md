# Golang Learning

This repository contains my learnings of Golang.

## Plan

My initial plan is to work through [Tour of Go] and [Go Programming Blueprints - 2nd Edition]. I will compliment these readings by building CLI and simple web servers.

Additional Readings:

- [Godoc: documenting Go code]
- [How to Write Go Code]
- [Effective Go]
