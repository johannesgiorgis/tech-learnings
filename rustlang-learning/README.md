# Rustlang Learning

This repository contains my learnings of Rustlang.

## Plan

My initial plan is to work through [Tour of Rust] and read through [The Rust Book] and [A Gentle Introduction to Rust]. Next, I will use a combination of codingames, exercism and rustlings for futher practice. Along the way, I will compliment these readings and practices by building small projects - e.g. CLI and simple web servers.

Additional Readings/Resources:

- [The Rust Book]
- [Rust Cookbook]
- [A Gentle Introduction to Rust]
- [Rust Cheat Sheet]
- [rustlings - small exercises]
- [exercism rust track]

## Progress

- [ ] [Tour of Rust]
- [ ] [A Gentle Introduction to Rust]
- [ ] [The Rust Book]
